# Group01_EEP153

#### This is a general how-to for Group 0/1 in working with GitHub for our initial projects in EEP 153. 

#### Our project files involving Jupyter Notebooks will be organized into folders in the main repository. 

### GitHub basics: 

In simple terms, GitHub is a "version control" environment software developers use to keep track of changes made in their code – the main idea is that if something goes wrong, one can always navigate back to earlier versions of a given code; GitHub makes this really seamless compared to saving and downloading separate versions of a given file every time a change is made. 

Terminal: if you're already comfortable with Terminal, GitHub is pretty easy to use, and you probably already know to use it. If you've never used Terminal, the best option (starting out) is to use GitHub Desktop. 

So: download and install GitHub Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/
Once you do this successfully, the program will automatically set up a folder somewhere in your Finder labelled "GitHub." (Go check to make sure it's there.) 

Now you want to get OUR group's repository into YOUR GitHub
