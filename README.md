# Group01_EEP153

##### This is a general how-to for Group 0/1 in working with GitHub for our initial projects in EEP 153. 
Our project files involving Jupyter Notebooks will be organized into folders in the main repository. 

## GitHub basics: 

In simple terms, GitHub is a "version control" environment software developers use to keep track of changes made in their code – the main idea is that if something goes wrong, one can always navigate back to earlier versions of a given code; GitHub makes this really seamless compared to saving and downloading separate versions of a given file every time a change is made. 

Terminal: if you're already comfortable with Terminal, GitHub is pretty easy to use, and you probably already know to use it. If you've never used Terminal, the best option (starting out) is to use GitHub Desktop. 

So: download and install GitHub Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/
Once you do this successfully, the program will automatically set up a folder somewhere in your Finder labelled "GitHub." (Go check to make sure it's there.)


Since you're here, that means that you accepted an invitation to this Kitagawa_EEP153 "repository." Don't get it twisted – "repository" is just a fancy name for a literal FOLDER (you could call your Google Drive folders "repositories.") In this context, it's different from your average "folder" like your "Downloads" because this one will hold version-controlled code with an online-accessible interface. Hence, this Kitagawa_EEP153 repository is where we'll store our work for Projects 0 and 1 in this new class! 

Because you accepted the invitation to this repository and also set up GitHub desktop, the GitHub folder on your computer should contain a folder called "Kitagawa_EEP153." Spoiler: this is the same folder as the one you're accessing online right now! As such, that folder should have the same two things this online one does: a file called "README.md" and a folder named
